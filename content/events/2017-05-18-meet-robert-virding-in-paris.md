Robert Virding is one of the inventors of Erlang. He is giving a talk
at the NCrafts.io conference. This is the opportunity to meet him
personally during our meetup around an open discussion.

** This meetup is limited to 20 persons MAX! **

There will be 3 speakers, and max 20 participants.

Speakers:

 - Robert Virding: problems in implementing OO on top of Erlang

 - Arnaud Wetzel: Introduction of Erlang strength with a simple home
   automation App

 - Beno√Æt Chesneau: using Erlang to build a modern database

The principles are:

 - no slidedeck, not preparation for speakers, just a good subject

 - a big table, everyone sitting all around, everyone is an actor of
   this discussion

 - each speaker will present a subject for 20 minutes, with a 5
   minutes Q&A

 - everyone can interrupt, given it is to bring something valuable to
   the discussion

Key rule: friendship and benevolence, teaching and learning.

Why? The greater goal is to make people meet and get out of their
comfort zone, accept challenge, exchange experiences, expose facts,
only mention opinions as such.

Secondarily share some French food and drink.

This meeting will be self-organised, which means we all help with
chairs, and cleaning at the end.
